/** @pagegroup{pageExamples,telnetcmd,Simple Telnet Command}

This example shows how to use the Command Processor Library, which will accept and process user
 commands.Connections can be made to the command processor through the serial port, or through 
 a telnet connection.TCP connections may also be used.
 
 To use the Command Processor Library, a set of callback functions are defined to accept user
 connections, handle authentication, handle disconnections, provide a prompt, and of course
 to process the commands.
