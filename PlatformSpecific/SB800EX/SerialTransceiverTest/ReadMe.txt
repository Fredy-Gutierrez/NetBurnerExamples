Application to demonstrate how to configure the SB800EX software programmable transceivers.

The SB800EX has the ability to switch between RS-232, RS-422 and RS-485 in software. This means
customers do not need to remove the cover and manually configure jumpers. This is a very simple
program demonstrating how you can modify these settings in your application.
