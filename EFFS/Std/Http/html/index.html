      <h1>HTML page &quot;index.htm&quot; compiled into the application
         code</h1>

      <p>This &quot;index.htm&quot; page was compiled as part of your
      application code, located in your project's HTML sub-directory.  It will
      be displayed only when there is no &quot;index.htm&quot; file located in
      the EFFS-STD flash file system.  To verify this, you can use Windows
      Explorer and search for the sample &quot;index.htm&quot; file in the
      project directory of this example via FTP.</p>
      
      <p>To display a directory of the external flash card, use "DIR" in the
      URL.  For example: <!--CPPCALL DoAddDirRefLink -->  <p>


      <p>HTML pages used for dynamic web content that contain the FUNCTIONCALL
      HTML tags must be known at compile time, and so must reside in the flash
      memory of the module.  These pages can reference files located in the
      EFFS-STD flash file system.</p>
