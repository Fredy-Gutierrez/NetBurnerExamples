DNS Client Example

DNS example using GetHostByName(), GetHostByName4() and GetHostByName6()
to resolve a name to an IP address for both IPv4 and IPv6. 

To run this program:
- Start MTTTY and connect to the debug serial port
- You will be prompted to enter a name, such as www.netburner.com
- The DNS IP address resolution will be displayed

For this example to function, your NetBurner device must have access to the
Internet, with a working configuration for the IP address, mask and gateway.
