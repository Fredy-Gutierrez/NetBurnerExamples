The TicTacToe application provides a number of simple examples:
 - Play tic tac toe, of course
 - Manipulate the LEDs on the NetBurner development board. This
 is an example of URL Encoding.
 - Echo web browser requests, so you can see what is sent to the
 web server.
 - Example of a meta tag to create a "reloading web page", which
 refreshes itself at 1 second intervals.
