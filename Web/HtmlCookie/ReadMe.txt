/** @pagegroup{Web,HtmlCookie,HTML Cookie Example}

 This example shows how to implement cookies with the NetBurner
 web server. The example program works as follows:
 
 - Three web pages are created: an index page, a page to set the
 cookie value to "MyCookie", and a page to view the cookie value.
 - When you run the program open a web browser and go to the index
 page.
 - Select the "set cookie" link to set the cookie. Note that if you
 select "show cookie" before setting the value, no value will
 be displayed.
 - Select the "show cookie" link to view the cookie
 
 A cookie will apply to a "site". In this example a "site" will
 probably be the IP address of your NetBurner device. The cookie
 will be sent as part of the HTML header for any page requested
 from the "site".
