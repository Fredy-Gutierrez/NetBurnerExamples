/** @pagegroup{Web,HtmlPassword,Simple HTML Password Example}

The Simple HTML Password Example is a basic demonstration of the NetBurner web
 server implementation. In this example, an HTML page is protected by
 plain text authentication.
 
 This is a very basic authentication example, and only tests that the
 username and password are identical. It's also worth noting
 that the web server will cache the username/password that is initially
 entered, so to retry the example, you would need to clear your cache.
