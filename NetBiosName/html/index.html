<h1>NetBios Name Example</h1>
This example program demonstrates how you can use the NetBios service to address<br>
your NetBurner device by name as well as IP address. Note that NetBios is different<br>
than DNS, and will only work on your local LAN, not the Internet. 
<br><br>
The NetBios Name can contain any alphanumeric character except: <br>
spaces, \ : / * ? ; | . It must be 15 characters or less.<br>
