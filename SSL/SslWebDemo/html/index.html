  This SSL (Secure Socket Layer) 
  example program is designed to demonstrate how you can create a web site with 
  protected content. A subdirectory called &quot;httpsdir&quot; contains all the 
  files that require SSL encryption. When a user tries to access any of these files 
  the application will check for a valid SSL connection. If the connection is valid 
  the user will be able to access the web page. If the connection is not valid, 
  meaning it is plain HTTP, then the access is deemed unauthorized and the user 
  sent a FORBIDDEN response code. This example uses a default SSL certificate that
  will generate some warnings because it was not made specifically for the IP
  address used at your location.

<b>Running the Example:</b>
<br>

<ol>
  <li>When you first view the page, you will probably be using HTTP (http://x.x.x.x/index.htm). You will 
    also notice that there is a graphic in the box below which indicates that 
    the connection is currently not secure. Try clicking on the &quot;View 
    httpsdir\repeat.html&quot; now.</li>
  <li>Since you are attempting to view the protected SSL page without without 
    SSL (ie http instead of https), you will be given a FORBIDDEN response code.</li>
  <li>Now click on the &quot;View index.htm with SSL&quot; link (https://x.x.x.x/index.htm).</li>
  <li>Now both links use https instead of http, so you can click on the protected page 
    link and access the files in the httpsdir directory. Click on the 
    &quot;Enter protected SSL page&quot; link.</li>
</ol>

        Clicking on this link will result in a FORBIDDEN response code for unsecure
        access (ie http), or will load the repeat.html page if the request uses
        SSL (ie https). The URL in the above link is set to http or https to match
        the URL of index.htm. To view repeat.html, first click on "View index.htm with SSL".
