                    This example demonstrates how to use the EFFS FileSystem in conjuction with our SSL Library in order to upload CA Lists which can be used to
                    verify incoming server certificates. To use this example, upload the CA through the web interface at <a href="CaCert.html">CaCert.html;</a>.  This file
                    should be in the .PEM format, and should be the parent CA of the certificate you wish to validate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From the serial terminal, hit 'C', and then enter in the domain that you want to test a connection against, e.g. <a href="https://www.netburner.com">www.netburner.com</a>.
                    The output on the terminal will tell you the status of the connection, and how many bytes are read after a successful connection.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If a connection has already been made when new CA's are added to the list, the device will need to be restarted for the lists to take effect.
