/** @pagegroup{SSL,SSL_pop3,SSL POP3 Mail}

This example demonstrates how to implement retrieving email from a server
that requires SSL.

When trying to connect to a Google Account, you will likely need to enable less secure
application access.  If you use two-factor authentication with your account, you will need
to setup an application password for the account being connected to. This can be done at
the following URL: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords

Note that when setting this up, it will tell you that you do not need to save
the password. For this example, this is not the case. The application password
is not stored anywhere, and will need to be reentered for every request.
