/** @pagegroup{pageExamples-TCP,pageExamples-TCP-TCPClientSimple,Simple Client Example}

This program demonstrates how to create a TCP Client. All interaction is
through the web page interface, which enables you to type a message as
well as the IP address and port number of the destination TCP server.
You should be able to use any TCP server. If you do not have one,
we have a windows example TCP server in the `\nburn\pctools\TCP\TcpServerWin`
directory (as well as source code).
