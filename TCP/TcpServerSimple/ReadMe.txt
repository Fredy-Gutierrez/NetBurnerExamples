This program will create a TCP server task, which listens on port 23 by
default. To test the application you can use Telnet. For example, from a
windows commpan prompt, type: 

`telnet <ip address of netburner>`

This example uses a simple read() function to receive data from a TCP
client. Refer to the TCP Multi Socket Server example to handle multiple
client connections.
