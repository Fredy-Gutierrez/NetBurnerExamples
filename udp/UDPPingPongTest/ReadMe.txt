This example program will receive a UDP packet from another device or
 host computer, and then send a response. To run the example, connect a serial
 port from your PC to the debug serial port on your NetBurner device and run a
 terminal program such as MTTTY. On the PC, run the NetBurner UDP Terminal
 (be sure to set the IP address and port numbers to match). Send data from the
 NetBurner UDP Terminal, and observe that the packet is received in MTTTY.
 Then observe the response from the device in the NetBurner UDP Terminal.
