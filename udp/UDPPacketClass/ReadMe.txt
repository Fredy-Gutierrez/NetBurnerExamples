This application will send/receive UDP packets with another host on a
 network, such as a PC. Use the MTTTY serial port program to access the menu
 and prompts to specify the destination IP address and port number.
 
 NetBurner supplies an API for handling UDP as a C++ Class using UDPPacket,
 or you can use a UDP sockets API (see UDP socket example).
 
 For an external UDP host you can use the NetBurner Java example, or the
 NetBurner UDP terminal program.
