This application will send/receive UDP packets with another host on a network,
 such as a PC. Use the MTTTY serial port program to access the menu and
 prompts to specify the destination IP address and port number.
 
 NetBurner also supplies an API for handling UDP as a C++ Class using UDPPacket.
 
 For an external UDP host you can use the NetBurner Java example, or the
 NetBurner UDP terminal program.
