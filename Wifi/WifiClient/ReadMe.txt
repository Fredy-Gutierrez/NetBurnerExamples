This example demonstrates how to connect to a wifi network and use the wifi
driver object to access the status information of the wifi connection.

If you are using a 5270 or 5234 processor based design it also enables spread
spectrum mode to reduce emissions that can interfere with the wifi radio. These
platforms should be using a wifi module with an external antenna.
