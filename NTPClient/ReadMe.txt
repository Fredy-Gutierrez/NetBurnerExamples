/** @pagegroup{pageExamples,NTPClient,NTP Client}

A simple example that will get the time from a NTP server and
display the UTC and PDT time through the debug serial port. 
Use MTTTY to monitor the output.

For this example to function, your NetBurner device must have access to the
Internet, with a working configuration for the IP address, mask and gateway.
